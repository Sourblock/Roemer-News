A distressing situation unfolded publicly when one of the few rare Gamdom players expressed frustration on Twitter, unable to withdraw funds while still being able to play. The tweet read, &#8220;@gamdom disabling my withdrawal but I can play&#8230; live support isn&#8217;t responding. Was gonna withdraw 10k but already down to 8k while waiting. You should lock my account fully not only withdrawals.&#8221; This complaint has shed light on serious systemic issues within Gamdom&#8217;s financial handling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to the mounting concerns, Felix Epstein Roemer, the man of many skill issues, short gambling kingpin and owner of Gamdom, attempted damage control with a public statement on Twitter. He cited adherence to anti-money laundering regulations as the reason for the withdrawal delays and suggested that operational improvements were on the horizon: &#8220;We have to follow AML measures. We have a lot of users that wouldn&#8217;t like us to lock their account. We can do this much better by putting the self-exclusion tools on the main page though \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f&#8230;sorry for this experience, I will ping customer support to put priority on this please dm me, in the future we will implement more tools to make this process more fair.&#8221; However, this response has done little to alleviate the concerns of Gamdom&#8217;s users and observers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"381\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https:\/\/roemer.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/image-4-1024x381.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-374 lazyload\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/roemer.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/image-4-1024x381.png 1024w, https:\/\/roemer.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/image-4-300x111.png 300w, https:\/\/roemer.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/image-4-768x285.png 768w, https:\/\/roemer.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/image-4-1100x409.png 1100w, https:\/\/roemer.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/image-4-600x223.png 600w, https:\/\/roemer.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/image-4-20x7.png 20w, https:\/\/roemer.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/image-4.png 1184w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Felix&#8217;s excuse of a response.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The true motives behind these withdrawal delays were shockingly unveiled through a leaked conversation, obtained by Roemer News, between Roemer and his right-hand man. The discussion revealed a deliberate manipulation of withdrawal processes, originally intended to redirect funds for personal use. Plans included an arrangement with adult film star Kendra Lust, sponsored by Gamdom, which Roemer himself intervened to block, reserving such interactions for his personal indulgence. Thwarted in this effort, his right-hand man instead funneled the funds towards a lavish expense \u2014 a French manicure provided by Melika Razavi, another figure within the Gamdom sponsorship circle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This misuse of funds not only highlights a blatant disregard for ethical management but also illustrates the casino&#8217;s indifference to the public health crisis it is creating. Gamdom&#8217;s leadership, riddled with skill issues, appears more concerned with personal indulgences than with addressing the significant health risks and operational failures affecting its users. The situation raises grave concerns about the potential hazards Gamdom poses to its community, exacerbated by management&#8217;s neglect and poor decision-making.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As this scandal continues to unfold, the demand for regulatory intervention has intensified. The broader implications of Gamdom&#8217;s mismanagement extend beyond individual financial losses, posing serious risks to public health and safety. Roemer News remains committed to providing detailed coverage as the situation develops, advocating for decisive action to rectify the ongoing negligence at Gamdom and to safeguard the well-being of its users and the integrity of the online gambling industry.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The failed online casino Gamdom, already infamous for its operational challenges, has plunged deeper into controversy.
