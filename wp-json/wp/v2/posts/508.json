He applied for a $4.5 million loan to acquire a luxurious property on Little Saint James island. However, in pure Roemer-esque fashion, the requested funds were not for buying the property but in reality were intended for R&amp;D of smart explosive pagers used in Israeli war crimes. Despite his cover story, the loan was denied due to failed background checks\u2014a collaborative effort by independent financial regulators, various banks, and diligent reporting by Roemer News.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After successfully fleeing Malta despite being on a no-fly list and circumventing French authorities with ease, Epstein Roemer sought to make his father&#8217;s island, Little Saint James, his next home\u2014not just as a personal retreat but as a research and development site for these heinous devices that were intended to be donated to the Israeli government. However, the comprehensive background checks, in collaboration with Roemer News, revealed concerns significant enough to halt any kind of financial assistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The property was seen as a potential attempt by Epstein Roemer to establish a more discreet base of operations, away from the prying eyes of law enforcement and the media. However, with plans now falling through, the property remains for sale, and Epstein Roemer is left stranded in France, unable to aid Israel in the killing of innocents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The denied loan raises further questions about Roemer&#8217;s current financial liquidity and his ability to sustain his lifestyle amid mounting legal pressures. The decision by the banks appears to be a significant turning point, as Felix Epstein Roemer is finally starting to face consequences for his actions. This development coincides with the growing influence of Roemer News, which has become increasingly impactful in its efforts to bring Epstein Roemer&#8217;s activities to a halt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the exact nature of the arrangement between Israel and Felix Epstein Roemer remains shrouded in mystery, Roemer News investigators are looking into the existence of a potential quid pro quo agreement. It is suspected that in exchange for Felix&#8217;s assistance with the development of smart explosive pagers\u2014devices intended for use in Israeli operations that would detonate when maximum damage would be possible\u2014Israel might offer support in alleviating Felix&#8217;s current legal and financial predicaments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s desperate attempts to evade justice continue, Roemer News remains committed to the pursuit of the truth\u2014<em>what really happened to Nick Garracks; why is Felix Epstein Roemer so desperate to get away?; what is Israel&#8217;s role in this?<\/em> With each of Epstein Roemer&#8217;s failures, attributed to his notorious skill issues, we inch closer to unraveling this web of deceit. Rest assured, dear readers, Roemer News will not cease until we expose the full extent of Epstein Roemer&#8217;s nefarious activities and bring closure to the Garracks case. The truth will prevail, and justice will be served\u2014no matter the cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Karl Sverre Following his successful escape from Malta through French borders, Felix Epstein Roemer attempted his next move in a scrappy plan to evade legal consequences and live in hiding.
