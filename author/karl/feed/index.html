<p>By Karl Sverre</p>



<p>In an alarming escalation of his increasingly erratic behavior, Felix Epstein Roemer, once notorious for his controversial leadership of the failed online casino Gamdom, has now proclaimed himself the cult leader of The Castle. In a dramatic public announcement, Epstein Roemer declared an all-out war on Sherbet, potentially signaling a troubling new phase in his career—a phase marked by delusional aggression and self-styled vigilantism.</p>



<p>After months of silence on Twitter since May, Felix Epstein Roemer broke his digital hibernation with a bombshell tweet that sent shockwaves through the online gaming community. In this unexpected return to social media, Epstein Roemer leveled serious accusations against Sherbet, claiming that the platform was actively scamming its users, claiming they are “out of money and just fund their expenses by robbing winning players.&#8221; This sudden and aggressive statement not only marked Epstein Roemer&#8217;s re-emergence into the public eye but also set the stage for his subsequent declaration of war against Sherbet, escalating tensions in an already volatile online gaming landscape.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdzutFKvuGjUcCv95Zfeey7I8mHxwAxTZfkQ8EOPL66RfCuZREujK6Z_QeAZTBiXS3tifZZr390Fo-2NzyDAqUhU1WZScYWyBGlEZz9ytSNUHPXjvqNFqmEaSCnNk2TWFlRTZ9NNvnwQwqHX9IEwdJYaWXN?key=8tUEZERjdRrvOryrLb5lRA" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s tweet, calling out Sherbet for scamming users.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the months leading up to this shocking declaration, Felix Epstein Roemer had been experiencing a notable mental decline. As new revelations about his past continued to surface, each &#8220;truth bomb&#8221; seemed to push him further into a downward spiral.</p>



<p>However, this recent outburst against Sherbet may not be a mere product of deteriorating mental health. At Roemer News, we have reason to believe that this could be part of a carefully orchestrated &#8220;redemption arc&#8221; for Felix. Our investigations suggest that this dramatic turn of events might have been engineered through a deal with none other than Nick Garracks, leading us to suspect that if he did indeed kidnap Garracks, it was to enlist his help in orchestrating this move.</p>



<p>Following his shocking Twitter comeback, Epstein Roemer made a dramatic reappearance on The Castle discord, proclaiming himself the &#8220;cultlord&#8221;. In this unexpected return, he stated, &#8220;I&#8217;m officially declaring war with Sherbet&#8221;, ominously adding that &#8220;Things are just heating up&#8221;. This wasn&#8217;t mere rhetoric—it was a direct call to action. Epstein Roemer urged his followers to take a confrontational stance against Sherbet, a platform he accused of deep-seated corruption and fraudulent operations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdrHF4tMnjZl_1U66PxbzuPJSj1Oa4Tfu46_X2GIoPs05eHQ8sYK1b7gW5wRQwoR-dSm4P19B3NZjumvRzD5qWgdygml1cuIpzGjf4EKiOiJ-o1Gf0XdU5shHvEIGcIplH-1mg27EJ6RguV6jRaFigQBd6n?key=8tUEZERjdRrvOryrLb5lRA" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s announcement to the cult, declaring war on Sherbet.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Epstein Roemer&#8217;s call to arms against Sherbet comes at a time when he claims to have &#8220;nothing to lose&#8221; and expresses a desire to &#8220;go all out&#8221; to expose scams and cleanse his tarnished reputation.</p>



<p>In his fiery speech, Epstein Roemer also issued a stark warning to former allies and associates, such as AyeZee, who had partnerships with Gamdom but subsequently left. Epstein Roemer ominously threatened, &#8220;Like Zeus, strikes will happen&#8221;. When Roemer News sought a follow-up comment from Felix on this matter, he cryptically responded, &#8220;I will have the last laugh. How can someone with no voice speak? Haha.&#8221;</p>



<p>As Felix Epstein Roemer steers The Castle into open conflict with Sherbet, the implications stretch far beyond the immediate drama. Roemer News continues to monitor this developing story, committed to uncovering the truths behind Epstein Roemer&#8217;s alarming new persona and the real motivations driving his war on Sherbet. Our investigation remains focused on ensuring that our readers are informed and prepared for the potential fallout from this unprecedented conflict in the gambling community.</p>

<p>By Karl Sverre</p>



<p>It has not even been one day since Felix Epstein Roemer has been stranded in France, yet it appears that he is already succumbing to a severe mental breakdown. Amidst mounting media pressure and escalating legal consequences, Epstein Roemer&#8217;s grasp on reality seems to be slipping, leading him into increasingly erratic behavior. Sources close to Felix Epstein Roemer report that he is reading Roemer News every day, out loud, in front of the mirror, and then proceeding to shout that “this is not even his final form”. As a team of independent reporters now bolsters Roemer News, there is now an increase in reports about Epstein Roemer&#8217;s tumultuous past and uncertain future. This article serves as a compilation of a few of the biggest stories we&#8217;ve been able to verify.</p>



<p>Once a flamboyant figure in the gambling world, Epstein Roemer&#8217;s association with Gamdom has ended in shame. Officially, Gamdom has severed ties with him, publicly dissociating from Epstein Roemer in an attempt to not only salvage its already—and heavily—tarnished reputation but also as an attempt at recovering the business. However, in a stunning display of denial, Epstein Roemer insists that it was he who abandoned the failing casino, claiming a desire to distance himself from &#8220;blacks&#8221;, stating that he no longer wants to work with Usain Bolt. This assertion stands in stark contrast to the reality of his ousting, which was more about Gamdom&#8217;s attempt to mitigate disaster than any voluntary departure by Epstein Roemer.</p>



<p>Roemer News has also uncovered that he has been secretly funding lavish and morally dubious parties at Little Saint James, often referred to as &#8220;Diddy Parties&#8221;, involving high-profile individuals like Sean &#8220;P. Diddy&#8221; Combs. These parties, underwritten by obscure funding sources—including contributions from the Israeli government—have been sites of unimaginable decadence and sinister activities. Reports suggest that guests who were uncircumcised were targeted and drugged, their foreskins clandestinely harvested in bizarre rituals.</p>



<p>Moreover, Epstein Roemer has been implicated in significant financial maneuvers, including a staggering $7.5 million transaction from Gamdom’s hot wallet to the personal crypto wallets of lawyers representing Sean Combs. This payment, intended as a retainer for Combs&#8217; legal defense, ties Roemer directly to ongoing legal strategies in high-profile circles.</p>



<p>Adding to the scandal, leaked footage from these infamous parties shows notable figures such as Kamala Harris and Bill Gates in attendance, with Gates reportedly aiding Roemer with financial transactions through Bitfinex. The presence of such high-profile individuals at events sponsored by Epstein Roemer raises grave questions about the extent and nature of his influence and the potentially far-reaching implications of his activities.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most intriguing and perplexing connection in Epstein Roemer&#8217;s web of associations is his ties to Israel. Despite his well-documented neo-Nazi leanings, our investigations have uncovered evidence of substantial financial backing from Israeli sources. This paradoxical relationship has led to two primary theories. The first is that Israel is conducting an elaborate psyop, using Epstein Roemer as a honeypot to attract and monitor neo-Nazi elements. By financially supporting a prominent far-right figure, Israeli intelligence agencies may be gathering crucial information on extremist networks.</p>



<p>Alternatively, the second theory suggests that Epstein Roemer, unable to fully escape his German Nazi ancestry, is cynically playing both sides. This dual allegiance, if true, would be a testament to his moral flexibility and opportunistic nature. However, the cognitive dissonance required to maintain such contradictory alliances may be contributing significantly to his apparent mental breakdown. The strain of reconciling his public neo-Nazi persona with his clandestine Israeli connections could be pushing Epstein Roemer to the brink of psychological collapse, explaining his increasingly erratic behavior and tenuous grip on reality.</p>



<p>As Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s world unravels, his actions become increasingly desperate. His recent petition to the Federal Court of New York to post bond for Sean Combs is just one example of his frantic attempts to maintain a semblance of control and relevance. However, these efforts only highlight his isolation and the growing consensus about his instability.</p>



<p>The situation is fluid and fraught with implications not just for Epstein Roemer, but for all associated with him. As Roemer News&#8217; influence grows, Felix Epstein Roemer is facing an escalating series of consequences. The increased scrutiny and wider reach of our reporting have led to more individuals and organizations—including Gamdom—distancing themselves from him. Legal authorities are taking notice, with investigations intensifying and potential charges looming. His business interests are crumbling, with partners and investors rapidly withdrawing support. Even his personal relationships are strained, as friends and associates seek to avoid being tainted by association.</p>



<p>As Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s mental state continues to deteriorate, the full implications of his apparent psychosis remain uncertain. The erratic behavior and increasingly bizarre actions of this once-influential figure raise numerous questions about what might unfold in the coming days and weeks. While it&#8217;s impossible to predict the exact course of events, Roemer News remains committed to providing thorough, accurate, and timely updates on this developing situation. Our team of dedicated reporters will continue to investigate, verify, and report on all aspects of this unfolding story, ensuring that the public stays informed about the consequences of Epstein Roemer&#8217;s actions and the broader implications for the gambling industry, international relations, and high-profile networks. As always, we pledge to deliver the facts as they emerge, no matter where they may lead.</p>

<p>By Karl Sverre</p>



<p>Following his successful escape from Malta through French borders, Felix Epstein Roemer attempted his next move in a scrappy plan to evade legal consequences and live in hiding. He applied for a $4.5 million loan to acquire a luxurious property on Little Saint James island. However, in pure Roemer-esque fashion, the requested funds were not for buying the property but in reality were intended for R&amp;D of smart explosive pagers used in Israeli war crimes. Despite his cover story, the loan was denied due to failed background checks—a collaborative effort by independent financial regulators, various banks, and diligent reporting by Roemer News.</p>



<p>After successfully fleeing Malta despite being on a no-fly list and circumventing French authorities with ease, Epstein Roemer sought to make his father&#8217;s island, Little Saint James, his next home—not just as a personal retreat but as a research and development site for these heinous devices that were intended to be donated to the Israeli government. However, the comprehensive background checks, in collaboration with Roemer News, revealed concerns significant enough to halt any kind of financial assistance.</p>



<p>The property was seen as a potential attempt by Epstein Roemer to establish a more discreet base of operations, away from the prying eyes of law enforcement and the media. However, with plans now falling through, the property remains for sale, and Epstein Roemer is left stranded in France, unable to aid Israel in the killing of innocents.</p>



<p>The denied loan raises further questions about Roemer&#8217;s current financial liquidity and his ability to sustain his lifestyle amid mounting legal pressures. The decision by the banks appears to be a significant turning point, as Felix Epstein Roemer is finally starting to face consequences for his actions. This development coincides with the growing influence of Roemer News, which has become increasingly impactful in its efforts to bring Epstein Roemer&#8217;s activities to a halt.</p>



<p>While the exact nature of the arrangement between Israel and Felix Epstein Roemer remains shrouded in mystery, Roemer News investigators are looking into the existence of a potential quid pro quo agreement. It is suspected that in exchange for Felix&#8217;s assistance with the development of smart explosive pagers—devices intended for use in Israeli operations that would detonate when maximum damage would be possible—Israel might offer support in alleviating Felix&#8217;s current legal and financial predicaments.</p>



<p>As Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s desperate attempts to evade justice continue, Roemer News remains committed to the pursuit of the truth—<em>what really happened to Nick Garracks; why is Felix Epstein Roemer so desperate to get away?; what is Israel&#8217;s role in this?</em> With each of Epstein Roemer&#8217;s failures, attributed to his notorious skill issues, we inch closer to unraveling this web of deceit. Rest assured, dear readers, Roemer News will not cease until we expose the full extent of Epstein Roemer&#8217;s nefarious activities and bring closure to the Garracks case. The truth will prevail, and justice will be served—no matter the cost.</p>

<p>By Karl Sverre</p>



<p>In a very concerning breach of international security protocols, Felix Epstein Roemer, who had recently been placed on Malta&#8217;s no-fly list following an increase in evidence linking him to Nick Garracks&#8217;s disappearance, has successfully evaded capture by exploiting linguistic barriers and diplomatic oversights by the French authorities at the airport.</p>



<p>Despite being on a no-fly list amid increasing links to Nick Garracks&#8217;s mysterious disappearance, Felix Epstein Roemer managed a daring escape from Malta—a development that amplifies suspicions of corruption and possible collusion within the Maltese authorities. These authorities had previously shown a disturbing lack of initiative in investigating Garracks&#8217;s whereabouts, raising questions about their efficacy and impartiality.</p>



<p>Once in France, Epstein Roemer was held for about 2 hours of questioning by French authorities at the airport regarding his grotesque history of criminal activities. However, due to his inability to speak French, Epstein Roemer simply responded with &#8220;Oui, oui, baguette, croissant&#8221; to every question asked during the entire interrogation. As a result, they made the perplexing decision to simply let him go.</p>



<p>Roemer News was unable to confirm how this decision came to be, but it has sparked varied reactions. Some commentators simply suggested this being a case of &#8220;classic French behavior,&#8221; claiming that the French authorities surrendered to Epstein Roemer, afraid of what could have happened to their families. Others believe that Felix&#8217;s nonsensical responses were actually interpreted as coherent answers, aligning precisely with what the authorities wanted to hear. &#8220;I think that Felix is a smart guy, he knows the French, and this is a calculated move by him. Felix, please hire me again,&#8221; said Juuso, who previously worked for Felix Epstein Roemer.</p>



<p>As news of this inexplicable escape spread, the world is left grappling with the implications of such a significant oversight. Nick Garracks is still missing, and there is increasing evidence pointing to Epstein Roemer&#8217;s involvement. Yet, Felix Epstein Roemer seems to be evading consequences, once again, in plain sight.</p>

<p>By Karl Sverre</p>



<p>In an unsettling turn of events that strikes at the heart of investigative journalism, Nick Garracks, our esteemed head news editor at Roemer News, has vanished under mysterious and foreboding circumstances. His disappearance followed his <a href="https://roemer.news/2024/08/23/breaking-news-felix-roemer-faces-public-indictment-at-lavish-party-dossier-to-be-released-soon/">announcement</a> of an impending release—a comprehensive dossier exposing Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s involvement in historical and ongoing global conspiracies. These revelations included Roemer&#8217;s role in the 9/11 attacks, in collaboration with American and Israeli governments to escalate mass surveillance measures. <em>Such explosive claims could reshape global narratives on privacy and security</em>.</p>



<p>For over three weeks, every attempt to trace Garracks has hit a dead end. Last seen at the Roemer News office in Malta, Garracks&#8217;s journey home remains incomplete, with communications ceasing around 7:20 PM. His absence has cast a chilling pall over our editorial team, sparking fears of foul play. Adding to these fears, Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s conspicuous silence and withdrawal from social media during this critical period have led us to believe that something significant is brewing. <em>After all, we&#8217;ve thoroughly studied Epstein Roemer&#8217;s playbook—such silence usually portends troubling times ahead.</em></p>



<p><em>Our investigative team was not in Malta when Mr. Garracks went missing. I believe that if they had been, they too would have vanished. Fortunately, since they weren&#8217;t there, they immediately began investigating, searching for all the traces Felix leaves behind due to his skill issues.</em></p>



<p>Our investigative team delved into Epstein Roemer&#8217;s recent financial transactions, uncovering a plethora of suspicious activities. Most notably, an Ethereum cold wallet address—dormant for nine years—suddenly sprang to life. It executed three large transfers of 250,000 USDT each to Russian wallets, raising suspicions of payments for illicit services, possibly linked to Garracks&#8217;s disappearance. Intriguingly, these transactions coincided with reports of a Russian vessel allegedly transporting Iranian ballistic missiles—<em>a development that could be part of Roemer&#8217;s broader strategy to divert attention from Nick Garracks</em>.</p>

<p>The disappearance of the courageous hosts of the <a href="https://roemer.news/2024/08/23/breaking-news-felix-roemer-faces-public-indictment-at-lavish-party-dossier-to-be-released-soon/">&#8220;Felix Roemer we know what you did&#8221; party</a>, initially believed to have been kidnapped like Nick Garracks, added an even more sinister detail to the story. We now suspect they are in hiding, fearing retribution from Epstein Roemer. This belief stems from a chilling message received in our email inbox: &#8220;We tried. It&#8217;s not gonna end up well. Run.&#8221; Our attempts to obtain a more detailed comment on the situation were met with silence.</p>



<p>Roemer News was able to get ahold of some cryptic messages sent by Felix into private group chats we have access to. One of them read &#8220;End times are coming. I don&#8217;t know what I will be doing, I know where I am gonna be&#8230; the fake ones I know, you claim you&#8217;re real?&#8221;. These messages paint a picture of a man fraught with anxiety and paranoia, a man crumbling under the weight of his own deceit.</p>



<p>Alarmed by Garracks&#8217;s sudden disappearance and the suspicious activities surrounding Epstein Roemer, interns at the Roemer News Maltese office promptly reported the incident to local law enforcement. They provided detailed information about Garracks&#8217;s last known whereabouts and the circumstances leading to his vanishing. However, the response from the authorities has been deeply troubling.</p>



<p>The local law enforcement&#8217;s apparent indifference to the gravity of Garracks&#8217;s disappearance and the related criminal activities involving Roemer is cause for serious concern. Despite Roemer News&#8217;s repeated appeals and submission of potentially incriminating evidence, the Maltese police have displayed a perplexing unwillingness to launch a thorough investigation. This lack of action has fuelled suspicions of potential complicity or intimidation within the police force.</p>



<p>After repeated attempts to release this article were thwarted by mysterious server crashes at Roemer News, we turned to alternative methods to disseminate this crucial information. In a desperate bid to broadcast these truths, we resorted to social media platforms. However, our efforts were met with unprecedented digital interference. It appears that Felix, in his desperation, had hastily hired a hacker to prevent Roemer News from posting, buying him time for further distractions. However, due to Felix&#8217;s notorious skill issues, this attempt was far from sophisticated.</p>



<p>In a coordinated effort to misdirect investigations, Felix exploited Twittimer to access high-profile Twitter accounts, including CSGOEmpire&#8217;s. By promoting a Solana address, he attempted to create a fake scam trail, aiming to divert attention from his implicated Ethereum addresses and potentially mislead investigators. However, this ploy backfired spectacularly. The transparent nature of blockchain transactions and the vigilance of the crypto community quickly exposed the ruse. Far from diverting attention, this ill-conceived attempt only served to intensify scrutiny on Felix&#8217;s activities, further cementing suspicions about his involvement in Garracks&#8217;s disappearance. Ironically, this botched scam did enable Felix to make more money than the previous 3 months of Gamdom’s GGR, his failed online casino, highlighting the unfortunate reality that even a poor attempt at a scam is more profitable than it.</p>
