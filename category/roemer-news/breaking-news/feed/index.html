<p>By Karl Sverre</p>



<p>In an unsettling turn of events that strikes at the heart of investigative journalism, Nick Garracks, our esteemed head news editor at Roemer News, has vanished under mysterious and foreboding circumstances. His disappearance followed his <a href="https://roemer.news/2024/08/23/breaking-news-felix-roemer-faces-public-indictment-at-lavish-party-dossier-to-be-released-soon/">announcement</a> of an impending release—a comprehensive dossier exposing Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s involvement in historical and ongoing global conspiracies. These revelations included Roemer&#8217;s role in the 9/11 attacks, in collaboration with American and Israeli governments to escalate mass surveillance measures. <em>Such explosive claims could reshape global narratives on privacy and security</em>.</p>



<p>For over three weeks, every attempt to trace Garracks has hit a dead end. Last seen at the Roemer News office in Malta, Garracks&#8217;s journey home remains incomplete, with communications ceasing around 7:20 PM. His absence has cast a chilling pall over our editorial team, sparking fears of foul play. Adding to these fears, Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s conspicuous silence and withdrawal from social media during this critical period have led us to believe that something significant is brewing. <em>After all, we&#8217;ve thoroughly studied Epstein Roemer&#8217;s playbook—such silence usually portends troubling times ahead.</em></p>



<p><em>Our investigative team was not in Malta when Mr. Garracks went missing. I believe that if they had been, they too would have vanished. Fortunately, since they weren&#8217;t there, they immediately began investigating, searching for all the traces Felix leaves behind due to his skill issues.</em></p>



<p>Our investigative team delved into Epstein Roemer&#8217;s recent financial transactions, uncovering a plethora of suspicious activities. Most notably, an Ethereum cold wallet address—dormant for nine years—suddenly sprang to life. It executed three large transfers of 250,000 USDT each to Russian wallets, raising suspicions of payments for illicit services, possibly linked to Garracks&#8217;s disappearance. Intriguingly, these transactions coincided with reports of a Russian vessel allegedly transporting Iranian ballistic missiles—<em>a development that could be part of Roemer&#8217;s broader strategy to divert attention from Nick Garracks</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1160" height="653" src="https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/russianvessel.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-491" srcset="https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/russianvessel.jpg 1160w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/russianvessel-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/russianvessel-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/russianvessel-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/russianvessel-1100x619.jpg 1100w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/russianvessel-600x338.jpg 600w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/russianvessel-20x11.jpg 20w" sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The vessel – the Port Olya 3 – was identified by Maxar Technologies in satellite imagery taken on September 4 at Port Olya in Astrakhan, Russia.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The disappearance of the courageous hosts of the <a href="https://roemer.news/2024/08/23/breaking-news-felix-roemer-faces-public-indictment-at-lavish-party-dossier-to-be-released-soon/">&#8220;Felix Roemer we know what you did&#8221; party</a>, initially believed to have been kidnapped like Nick Garracks, added an even more sinister detail to the story. We now suspect they are in hiding, fearing retribution from Epstein Roemer. This belief stems from a chilling message received in our email inbox: &#8220;We tried. It&#8217;s not gonna end up well. Run.&#8221; Our attempts to obtain a more detailed comment on the situation were met with silence.</p>



<p>Roemer News was able to get ahold of some cryptic messages sent by Felix into private group chats we have access to. One of them read &#8220;End times are coming. I don&#8217;t know what I will be doing, I know where I am gonna be&#8230; the fake ones I know, you claim you&#8217;re real?&#8221;. These messages paint a picture of a man fraught with anxiety and paranoia, a man crumbling under the weight of his own deceit.</p>



<p>Alarmed by Garracks&#8217;s sudden disappearance and the suspicious activities surrounding Epstein Roemer, interns at the Roemer News Maltese office promptly reported the incident to local law enforcement. They provided detailed information about Garracks&#8217;s last known whereabouts and the circumstances leading to his vanishing. However, the response from the authorities has been deeply troubling.</p>



<p>The local law enforcement&#8217;s apparent indifference to the gravity of Garracks&#8217;s disappearance and the related criminal activities involving Roemer is cause for serious concern. Despite Roemer News&#8217;s repeated appeals and submission of potentially incriminating evidence, the Maltese police have displayed a perplexing unwillingness to launch a thorough investigation. This lack of action has fuelled suspicions of potential complicity or intimidation within the police force.</p>



<p>After repeated attempts to release this article were thwarted by mysterious server crashes at Roemer News, we turned to alternative methods to disseminate this crucial information. In a desperate bid to broadcast these truths, we resorted to social media platforms. However, our efforts were met with unprecedented digital interference. It appears that Felix, in his desperation, had hastily hired a hacker to prevent Roemer News from posting, buying him time for further distractions. However, due to Felix&#8217;s notorious skill issues, this attempt was far from sophisticated.</p>



<p>In a coordinated effort to misdirect investigations, Felix exploited Twittimer to access high-profile Twitter accounts, including CSGOEmpire&#8217;s. By promoting a Solana address, he attempted to create a fake scam trail, aiming to divert attention from his implicated Ethereum addresses and potentially mislead investigators. However, this ploy backfired spectacularly. The transparent nature of blockchain transactions and the vigilance of the crypto community quickly exposed the ruse. Far from diverting attention, this ill-conceived attempt only served to intensify scrutiny on Felix&#8217;s activities, further cementing suspicions about his involvement in Garracks&#8217;s disappearance. Ironically, this botched scam did enable Felix to make more money than the previous 3 months of Gamdom’s GGR, his failed online casino, highlighting the unfortunate reality that even a poor attempt at a scam is more profitable than it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="823" src="https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hackedtweet-1024x823.png" alt="" class="wp-image-492" srcset="https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hackedtweet-1024x823.png 1024w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hackedtweet-300x241.png 300w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hackedtweet-768x617.png 768w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hackedtweet-600x482.png 600w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hackedtweet-20x16.png 20w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hackedtweet.png 1038w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s tweet on the CSGOEmpire account, done via the Twittimer hack.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As Roemer News continues to champion the quest for truth and justice, we remain vigilant and unyielded by the shadows that seek to suppress our voice. The stakes have never been higher, not only for the safety of our beloved colleague but for the integrity of journalism and the very essence of public trust.</p>



<p>In response to these shocking revelations, protests and demonstrations are already being organised in Malta by fans of Nick Garracks&#8217;s work. The public outcry serves as a testament to the impact of Garracks&#8217;s journalism and the widespread demand for answers. Roemer News stands in solidarity with these supporters and reaffirms our unwavering commitment to uncovering the truth.</p>



<p>We want to make it clear: Roemer News will not rest until we find Nick Garracks and get to the bottom of everything. Despite the risks, we remain committed to publishing the dossier that Nick was working on releasing. The public deserves to know the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it may be for those in power.</p>



<p>I<em>n closing, I want to emphasise that no one should be forced into hiding because of a monster like Felix Epstein Roemer. Journalism is the cornerstone of a free and informed society, and we will continue to fight for that freedom, no matter the cost. The truth will prevail, and justice will be served.</em></p>

<p>In an unprecedented event, a lavish party held last night at a club in an undisclosed location, attended by high-profile celebrities including sprinter Usain Bolt, transformed into a public indictment of Felix Epstein Roemer, the man of many skill issues. Throughout the evening, attendees were encircled by screens emphatically displaying the message, &#8220;Felix Roemer we know what you did&#8221;. This provoked a unified chant from the crowd, creating a resounding echo of disapproval against Epstein Roemer&#8217;s long history of criminal misconduct.</p>



<p>The evening&#8217;s atmosphere thickened when the event hosts vowed to reveal detailed accusations against Roemer within the coming week. One host, who identified himself only as a &#8220;cat&#8221;, sent a direct video message to Roemer News in which he was heard emphatically stating, &#8220;Fuck you, Felix&#8221;. His words, marked by stark vehemence, mirrored the intense resentment and the serious nature of the impending charges against Epstein Roemer. This bold exchange set the stage for the forthcoming revelations that could expose a series of unheard-of nefarious activities from the “Ketamine King”.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fuckyoufelix.mov"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The &#8220;cat&#8221; shouting &#8220;Fuck you, Felix&#8221; and Usain Bolt.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Amid the electric atmosphere at the party, the hosts revealed that they would not be silenced and made a vow to turn public all that remains hidden about Felix Epstein Roemer.</p>



<p>As the night unfolded, the tension within the venue only grew, fuelled by the ominous promises of the hosts and the relentless chanting of the crowd. The atmosphere was charged with anticipation as if everyone present understood that they were witnessing the beginning of something far greater than a mere social gathering. The screens continued to flash the accusatory message, &#8220;Felix Roemer we know what you did&#8221;, serving as a constant reminder of the reckoning that awaited.</p>



<p>Guests, who had initially arrived for what they believed would be an evening of celebration, found themselves drawn into a collective fervour, united in their condemnation of Epstein Roemer. The transformation of the event from a party to a public tribunal was swift and unsettling, with the grandeur of the setting only heightening the sense of impending doom for the man of many skill issues. Celebrities and influencers, who usually maintained a careful distance from controversy, were now openly participating in the chant, their voices joining the chorus of outrage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/weknowhatyoudid.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The initial moment when the screens at the party started to display the ominous message, &#8220;Felix Roemer we know what you did&#8221;.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As the clock ticked closer to midnight, another unexpected twist took place as a series of video clips were projected onto the massive screens, showing what appeared to be clandestine footage of Felix Roemer involved in various questionable activities. Though the clips were brief and shrouded in mystery, they were enough to stoke the flames of the crowd&#8217;s indignation. Gasps and murmurs of disbelief rippled through the room as the true extent of Roemer&#8217;s misdeeds began to surface.</p>



<p>Amid this spectacle, “the cat&#8221; returned to the stage, this time with a group of masked individuals who were introduced as key witnesses to Epstein Roemer&#8217;s crimes. Though their identities remained hidden, their presence added a layer of gravity to the situation. Speaking through voice modulators, they provided cryptic but damning statements about Epstein Roemer’s actions, further solidifying the image of him as a figure who had long operated in the shadows, evading accountability.</p>



<p>The party reached its climax when the hosts announced that a comprehensive dossier on Felix Roemer&#8217;s illegal activities would be released to the public in exactly seven days. &#8220;The time for secrets is over&#8221;, they declared.</p>



<p>As the night came to a close, the weight of what had transpired hung heavily in the air. What began as a glamorous gathering had transformed into a moment of reckoning, leaving no doubt that Felix Epstein Roemer’s days of evasion were numbered. The chants, the revelations, and the ominous promise of a forthcoming dossier all pointed to one inevitable outcome: the truth would soon emerge, and with it, the full measure of Epstein Roemer&#8217;s actions would be laid bare for all to see.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Roemer News will ensure the full dossier is published, making the truth known and holding those responsible accountable.</em></p>

<p>In a shocking turn of events that has rocked the esports world, gaming new evidence has emerged pointing to Felix Epstein Roemer, dubbed worldwide as “the man of many skill issues”, a highly controversial figure with a history of making headlines, as the mastermind behind the recent protest at the CS2 Copenhagen Major, a tournament that has been the pinnacle of Counter-Strike 2 competition. The protest, which led to the trophy being smashed into pieces during a high-tension match, was initially attributed to Monarch, the owner of CSGOEmpire, who had seemingly taken responsibility for the disruptive act.</p>



<p>However, in-depth investigations conducted by our highly decorated research team (hand picked by our head writer, Nick Garracks), have revealed that Felix Epstein Roemer orchestrated the entire protest, cleverly manipulating the situation to cast blame on Monarch and CSGOEmpire. Our sources have disclosed that Roemer paid off Monarch with a staggering $163,000 Patek Philippe watch, persuading him to take the fall and pretend that he and CSGOEmpire were behind the protest. This revelation has sent shockwaves through the community, leaving fans and stakeholders bewildered at the complexity and audacity of Roemer&#8217;s plot.</p>

<p>Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s leaked message, claiming that he had paid for the watch, which he would later follow up with instructions for the protest.</p>
</div></div>



<p>The protest at the CS2 Copenhagen Major was not just a moment of chaos but a meticulously planned act of deception. Roemer, leveraging his resources and influence, managed to stay in the shadows while directing the spotlight onto Monarch, who was apparently forced to livestream by him, in order to publicly make bold claims that he could not later take back. One of them was straight up claiming ownership of the stunt, as well as making inflammatory remarks about security and his willingness to &#8220;outpay everyone”. The motivations behind Roemer&#8217;s involvement are still being unraveled, but it&#8217;s speculated that this was most likely an act of revenge after the “Raging Rex” incident, where <a href="https://roemer.news/2024/03/16/unsurprising-felix-epstein-roemer-instantly-loses-2-4-million-playing-table-tennis/">Epstein Roemer instantly lost $2,400,000 playing table tennis</a> against Monarch.</p>



<p><br>What came as a very bewildering twist to the plot was the involvement of none other than Usain Bolt, the world-renowned sprinter. Bolt, known for his lightning-fast speeds on the track, made a dashing appearance as one of the key protesters, rushing onto the stage with such velocity that none could catch him. This stunning involvement of an athletic superstar in the esports protest not only amplified the shock value of the event but also left attendees and viewers in awe of the spectacle. There was but one catch, however. Bolt’s appearance raised a considerable amount of suspicions that Gamdom — and particularly, Felix Epstein Roemer — might have had a part in pulling off the whole thing.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:35% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><video controls src="https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/usainbolt.mp4"></video></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Usain Bolt running into the stage.</p>
</div></div>



<p>As videos of Usain Bolt&#8217;s unexpected dash across the stage at the CS2 Copenhagen Major began circulating online, the investigative team at Roemer News was swiftly mobilised to delve into the unfolding situation. The connection between Bolt, one of the most celebrated athletes in the world, and Gamdom, for whom he serves as a brand ambassador, immediately drew attention. The involvement of a figure as high-profile as Bolt in the protest not only raised eyebrows but also hinted at a deeper layer of orchestration behind the scenes.</p>



<p>The investigation into the protest at the CS2 Copenhagen Major, spearheaded by Roemer News, inadvertently unearthed a potentially more sinister dimension to Felix Roemer Epstein&#8217;s activities. As the investigative team delved deeper into the connections between Epstein, Gamdom, and the staged protest, they stumbled upon allegations linking Epstein to the Jofa&#8217;s Network of Sinners Active Search Team (JNSAST), a cult sub-organisation. This aspect of the investigation is still in its early stages, but it is poised to uncover potentially groundbreaking insights into a hidden layer of digital and social manipulation.</p>

<p>Sources indicate that Monarch, along with a team of detectives, conducted a thorough investigation at Gamdom&#8217;s office, which was initiated due to Felix Roemer&#8217;s connections with Jeffrey Epstein. The exact nature of the findings has not yet been disclosed publicly, but reports suggest that they could be significant. Details about what has been termed as Felix&#8217;s &#8220;second nonce issue&#8221; are sparse, and officials have not released any specific information regarding these allegations, but it may suggest something heinous due to the term’s association with child molestation.</p>



<p>During the investigation, authorities reportedly sifted through a vast amount of digital data and company records at Gamdom&#8217;s office. One detective involved in the case mentioned that the investigation was surprisingly straightforward, attributing this to Felix Roemer&#8217;s reputed &#8220;skill issues&#8221; which allegedly left incriminating evidence in the open. While the full extent of the findings is still under wraps, insiders close to the situation indicate that, despite the apparent ease of the investigation, it was conducted with meticulous and comprehensive attention to detail.</p>



<p>Legal experts have noted that the swift action taken in this case was facilitated by Monarch&#8217;s Lawyer, renowned for expertise in all fields of law. This expertise contributed to the unusual speed and decisiveness of the proceedings, underscoring the serious approach Monarch and his legal team are taking in this case. The decision to place Roemer under house arrest is a clear indication of the significant escalation in the ongoing scrutiny of Gamdom&#8217;s business practices. When questioned about the legal proceedings of the case, Monarch’s Lawyer simply commented “There once was a rat, I’ll catch him the slack”.</p>



<p>During the trial, the court set forth a unique condition for Felix Roemer’s release from house arrest. Roemer was ordered to purchase a Patek Aquanaut watch, a luxury item, as a symbolic fee for Monarch. Additionally, the court mandated Roemer to publicly acknowledge his personal and professional shortcomings, particularly emphasizing his self-admitted skill issues.</p>



<p>As this story develops, industry observers and legal analysts are closely watching the implications for Gamdom and the broader online gaming community.</p>



<p>Felix Roemer&#8217;s legal team has not yet made a public statement regarding the current situation. As details remain limited, the public and media are awaiting further developments to fully understand the scope and impact of these recent events.</p>
