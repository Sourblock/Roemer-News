<p>By Karl Sverre</p>



<p>In an alarming escalation of his increasingly erratic behavior, Felix Epstein Roemer, once notorious for his controversial leadership of the failed online casino Gamdom, has now proclaimed himself the cult leader of The Castle. In a dramatic public announcement, Epstein Roemer declared an all-out war on Sherbet, potentially signaling a troubling new phase in his career—a phase marked by delusional aggression and self-styled vigilantism.</p>



<p>After months of silence on Twitter since May, Felix Epstein Roemer broke his digital hibernation with a bombshell tweet that sent shockwaves through the online gaming community. In this unexpected return to social media, Epstein Roemer leveled serious accusations against Sherbet, claiming that the platform was actively scamming its users, claiming they are “out of money and just fund their expenses by robbing winning players.&#8221; This sudden and aggressive statement not only marked Epstein Roemer&#8217;s re-emergence into the public eye but also set the stage for his subsequent declaration of war against Sherbet, escalating tensions in an already volatile online gaming landscape.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdzutFKvuGjUcCv95Zfeey7I8mHxwAxTZfkQ8EOPL66RfCuZREujK6Z_QeAZTBiXS3tifZZr390Fo-2NzyDAqUhU1WZScYWyBGlEZz9ytSNUHPXjvqNFqmEaSCnNk2TWFlRTZ9NNvnwQwqHX9IEwdJYaWXN?key=8tUEZERjdRrvOryrLb5lRA" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s tweet, calling out Sherbet for scamming users.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the months leading up to this shocking declaration, Felix Epstein Roemer had been experiencing a notable mental decline. As new revelations about his past continued to surface, each &#8220;truth bomb&#8221; seemed to push him further into a downward spiral.</p>



<p>However, this recent outburst against Sherbet may not be a mere product of deteriorating mental health. At Roemer News, we have reason to believe that this could be part of a carefully orchestrated &#8220;redemption arc&#8221; for Felix. Our investigations suggest that this dramatic turn of events might have been engineered through a deal with none other than Nick Garracks, leading us to suspect that if he did indeed kidnap Garracks, it was to enlist his help in orchestrating this move.</p>



<p>Following his shocking Twitter comeback, Epstein Roemer made a dramatic reappearance on The Castle discord, proclaiming himself the &#8220;cultlord&#8221;. In this unexpected return, he stated, &#8220;I&#8217;m officially declaring war with Sherbet&#8221;, ominously adding that &#8220;Things are just heating up&#8221;. This wasn&#8217;t mere rhetoric—it was a direct call to action. Epstein Roemer urged his followers to take a confrontational stance against Sherbet, a platform he accused of deep-seated corruption and fraudulent operations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdrHF4tMnjZl_1U66PxbzuPJSj1Oa4Tfu46_X2GIoPs05eHQ8sYK1b7gW5wRQwoR-dSm4P19B3NZjumvRzD5qWgdygml1cuIpzGjf4EKiOiJ-o1Gf0XdU5shHvEIGcIplH-1mg27EJ6RguV6jRaFigQBd6n?key=8tUEZERjdRrvOryrLb5lRA" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s announcement to the cult, declaring war on Sherbet.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Epstein Roemer&#8217;s call to arms against Sherbet comes at a time when he claims to have &#8220;nothing to lose&#8221; and expresses a desire to &#8220;go all out&#8221; to expose scams and cleanse his tarnished reputation.</p>



<p>In his fiery speech, Epstein Roemer also issued a stark warning to former allies and associates, such as AyeZee, who had partnerships with Gamdom but subsequently left. Epstein Roemer ominously threatened, &#8220;Like Zeus, strikes will happen&#8221;. When Roemer News sought a follow-up comment from Felix on this matter, he cryptically responded, &#8220;I will have the last laugh. How can someone with no voice speak? Haha.&#8221;</p>



<p>As Felix Epstein Roemer steers The Castle into open conflict with Sherbet, the implications stretch far beyond the immediate drama. Roemer News continues to monitor this developing story, committed to uncovering the truths behind Epstein Roemer&#8217;s alarming new persona and the real motivations driving his war on Sherbet. Our investigation remains focused on ensuring that our readers are informed and prepared for the potential fallout from this unprecedented conflict in the gambling community.</p>

<p>By Karl Sverre</p>



<p>It has not even been one day since Felix Epstein Roemer has been stranded in France, yet it appears that he is already succumbing to a severe mental breakdown. Amidst mounting media pressure and escalating legal consequences, Epstein Roemer&#8217;s grasp on reality seems to be slipping, leading him into increasingly erratic behavior. Sources close to Felix Epstein Roemer report that he is reading Roemer News every day, out loud, in front of the mirror, and then proceeding to shout that “this is not even his final form”. As a team of independent reporters now bolsters Roemer News, there is now an increase in reports about Epstein Roemer&#8217;s tumultuous past and uncertain future. This article serves as a compilation of a few of the biggest stories we&#8217;ve been able to verify.</p>



<p>Once a flamboyant figure in the gambling world, Epstein Roemer&#8217;s association with Gamdom has ended in shame. Officially, Gamdom has severed ties with him, publicly dissociating from Epstein Roemer in an attempt to not only salvage its already—and heavily—tarnished reputation but also as an attempt at recovering the business. However, in a stunning display of denial, Epstein Roemer insists that it was he who abandoned the failing casino, claiming a desire to distance himself from &#8220;blacks&#8221;, stating that he no longer wants to work with Usain Bolt. This assertion stands in stark contrast to the reality of his ousting, which was more about Gamdom&#8217;s attempt to mitigate disaster than any voluntary departure by Epstein Roemer.</p>



<p>Roemer News has also uncovered that he has been secretly funding lavish and morally dubious parties at Little Saint James, often referred to as &#8220;Diddy Parties&#8221;, involving high-profile individuals like Sean &#8220;P. Diddy&#8221; Combs. These parties, underwritten by obscure funding sources—including contributions from the Israeli government—have been sites of unimaginable decadence and sinister activities. Reports suggest that guests who were uncircumcised were targeted and drugged, their foreskins clandestinely harvested in bizarre rituals.</p>



<p>Moreover, Epstein Roemer has been implicated in significant financial maneuvers, including a staggering $7.5 million transaction from Gamdom’s hot wallet to the personal crypto wallets of lawyers representing Sean Combs. This payment, intended as a retainer for Combs&#8217; legal defense, ties Roemer directly to ongoing legal strategies in high-profile circles.</p>



<p>Adding to the scandal, leaked footage from these infamous parties shows notable figures such as Kamala Harris and Bill Gates in attendance, with Gates reportedly aiding Roemer with financial transactions through Bitfinex. The presence of such high-profile individuals at events sponsored by Epstein Roemer raises grave questions about the extent and nature of his influence and the potentially far-reaching implications of his activities.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most intriguing and perplexing connection in Epstein Roemer&#8217;s web of associations is his ties to Israel. Despite his well-documented neo-Nazi leanings, our investigations have uncovered evidence of substantial financial backing from Israeli sources. This paradoxical relationship has led to two primary theories. The first is that Israel is conducting an elaborate psyop, using Epstein Roemer as a honeypot to attract and monitor neo-Nazi elements. By financially supporting a prominent far-right figure, Israeli intelligence agencies may be gathering crucial information on extremist networks.</p>



<p>Alternatively, the second theory suggests that Epstein Roemer, unable to fully escape his German Nazi ancestry, is cynically playing both sides. This dual allegiance, if true, would be a testament to his moral flexibility and opportunistic nature. However, the cognitive dissonance required to maintain such contradictory alliances may be contributing significantly to his apparent mental breakdown. The strain of reconciling his public neo-Nazi persona with his clandestine Israeli connections could be pushing Epstein Roemer to the brink of psychological collapse, explaining his increasingly erratic behavior and tenuous grip on reality.</p>



<p>As Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s world unravels, his actions become increasingly desperate. His recent petition to the Federal Court of New York to post bond for Sean Combs is just one example of his frantic attempts to maintain a semblance of control and relevance. However, these efforts only highlight his isolation and the growing consensus about his instability.</p>



<p>The situation is fluid and fraught with implications not just for Epstein Roemer, but for all associated with him. As Roemer News&#8217; influence grows, Felix Epstein Roemer is facing an escalating series of consequences. The increased scrutiny and wider reach of our reporting have led to more individuals and organizations—including Gamdom—distancing themselves from him. Legal authorities are taking notice, with investigations intensifying and potential charges looming. His business interests are crumbling, with partners and investors rapidly withdrawing support. Even his personal relationships are strained, as friends and associates seek to avoid being tainted by association.</p>



<p>As Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s mental state continues to deteriorate, the full implications of his apparent psychosis remain uncertain. The erratic behavior and increasingly bizarre actions of this once-influential figure raise numerous questions about what might unfold in the coming days and weeks. While it&#8217;s impossible to predict the exact course of events, Roemer News remains committed to providing thorough, accurate, and timely updates on this developing situation. Our team of dedicated reporters will continue to investigate, verify, and report on all aspects of this unfolding story, ensuring that the public stays informed about the consequences of Epstein Roemer&#8217;s actions and the broader implications for the gambling industry, international relations, and high-profile networks. As always, we pledge to deliver the facts as they emerge, no matter where they may lead.</p>

<p>By Karl Sverre</p>



<p>Following his successful escape from Malta through French borders, Felix Epstein Roemer attempted his next move in a scrappy plan to evade legal consequences and live in hiding. He applied for a $4.5 million loan to acquire a luxurious property on Little Saint James island. However, in pure Roemer-esque fashion, the requested funds were not for buying the property but in reality were intended for R&amp;D of smart explosive pagers used in Israeli war crimes. Despite his cover story, the loan was denied due to failed background checks—a collaborative effort by independent financial regulators, various banks, and diligent reporting by Roemer News.</p>



<p>After successfully fleeing Malta despite being on a no-fly list and circumventing French authorities with ease, Epstein Roemer sought to make his father&#8217;s island, Little Saint James, his next home—not just as a personal retreat but as a research and development site for these heinous devices that were intended to be donated to the Israeli government. However, the comprehensive background checks, in collaboration with Roemer News, revealed concerns significant enough to halt any kind of financial assistance.</p>



<p>The property was seen as a potential attempt by Epstein Roemer to establish a more discreet base of operations, away from the prying eyes of law enforcement and the media. However, with plans now falling through, the property remains for sale, and Epstein Roemer is left stranded in France, unable to aid Israel in the killing of innocents.</p>



<p>The denied loan raises further questions about Roemer&#8217;s current financial liquidity and his ability to sustain his lifestyle amid mounting legal pressures. The decision by the banks appears to be a significant turning point, as Felix Epstein Roemer is finally starting to face consequences for his actions. This development coincides with the growing influence of Roemer News, which has become increasingly impactful in its efforts to bring Epstein Roemer&#8217;s activities to a halt.</p>



<p>While the exact nature of the arrangement between Israel and Felix Epstein Roemer remains shrouded in mystery, Roemer News investigators are looking into the existence of a potential quid pro quo agreement. It is suspected that in exchange for Felix&#8217;s assistance with the development of smart explosive pagers—devices intended for use in Israeli operations that would detonate when maximum damage would be possible—Israel might offer support in alleviating Felix&#8217;s current legal and financial predicaments.</p>



<p>As Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s desperate attempts to evade justice continue, Roemer News remains committed to the pursuit of the truth—<em>what really happened to Nick Garracks; why is Felix Epstein Roemer so desperate to get away?; what is Israel&#8217;s role in this?</em> With each of Epstein Roemer&#8217;s failures, attributed to his notorious skill issues, we inch closer to unraveling this web of deceit. Rest assured, dear readers, Roemer News will not cease until we expose the full extent of Epstein Roemer&#8217;s nefarious activities and bring closure to the Garracks case. The truth will prevail, and justice will be served—no matter the cost.</p>

<p>By Karl Sverre</p>



<p>In a very concerning breach of international security protocols, Felix Epstein Roemer, who had recently been placed on Malta&#8217;s no-fly list following an increase in evidence linking him to Nick Garracks&#8217;s disappearance, has successfully evaded capture by exploiting linguistic barriers and diplomatic oversights by the French authorities at the airport.</p>



<p>Despite being on a no-fly list amid increasing links to Nick Garracks&#8217;s mysterious disappearance, Felix Epstein Roemer managed a daring escape from Malta—a development that amplifies suspicions of corruption and possible collusion within the Maltese authorities. These authorities had previously shown a disturbing lack of initiative in investigating Garracks&#8217;s whereabouts, raising questions about their efficacy and impartiality.</p>



<p>Once in France, Epstein Roemer was held for about 2 hours of questioning by French authorities at the airport regarding his grotesque history of criminal activities. However, due to his inability to speak French, Epstein Roemer simply responded with &#8220;Oui, oui, baguette, croissant&#8221; to every question asked during the entire interrogation. As a result, they made the perplexing decision to simply let him go.</p>



<p>Roemer News was unable to confirm how this decision came to be, but it has sparked varied reactions. Some commentators simply suggested this being a case of &#8220;classic French behavior,&#8221; claiming that the French authorities surrendered to Epstein Roemer, afraid of what could have happened to their families. Others believe that Felix&#8217;s nonsensical responses were actually interpreted as coherent answers, aligning precisely with what the authorities wanted to hear. &#8220;I think that Felix is a smart guy, he knows the French, and this is a calculated move by him. Felix, please hire me again,&#8221; said Juuso, who previously worked for Felix Epstein Roemer.</p>



<p>As news of this inexplicable escape spread, the world is left grappling with the implications of such a significant oversight. Nick Garracks is still missing, and there is increasing evidence pointing to Epstein Roemer&#8217;s involvement. Yet, Felix Epstein Roemer seems to be evading consequences, once again, in plain sight.</p>

<p>By Karl Sverre</p>



<p>In an unsettling turn of events that strikes at the heart of investigative journalism, Nick Garracks, our esteemed head news editor at Roemer News, has vanished under mysterious and foreboding circumstances. His disappearance followed his <a href="https://roemer.news/2024/08/23/breaking-news-felix-roemer-faces-public-indictment-at-lavish-party-dossier-to-be-released-soon/">announcement</a> of an impending release—a comprehensive dossier exposing Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s involvement in historical and ongoing global conspiracies. These revelations included Roemer&#8217;s role in the 9/11 attacks, in collaboration with American and Israeli governments to escalate mass surveillance measures. <em>Such explosive claims could reshape global narratives on privacy and security</em>.</p>



<p>For over three weeks, every attempt to trace Garracks has hit a dead end. Last seen at the Roemer News office in Malta, Garracks&#8217;s journey home remains incomplete, with communications ceasing around 7:20 PM. His absence has cast a chilling pall over our editorial team, sparking fears of foul play. Adding to these fears, Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s conspicuous silence and withdrawal from social media during this critical period have led us to believe that something significant is brewing. <em>After all, we&#8217;ve thoroughly studied Epstein Roemer&#8217;s playbook—such silence usually portends troubling times ahead.</em></p>



<p><em>Our investigative team was not in Malta when Mr. Garracks went missing. I believe that if they had been, they too would have vanished. Fortunately, since they weren&#8217;t there, they immediately began investigating, searching for all the traces Felix leaves behind due to his skill issues.</em></p>



<p>Our investigative team delved into Epstein Roemer&#8217;s recent financial transactions, uncovering a plethora of suspicious activities. Most notably, an Ethereum cold wallet address—dormant for nine years—suddenly sprang to life. It executed three large transfers of 250,000 USDT each to Russian wallets, raising suspicions of payments for illicit services, possibly linked to Garracks&#8217;s disappearance. Intriguingly, these transactions coincided with reports of a Russian vessel allegedly transporting Iranian ballistic missiles—<em>a development that could be part of Roemer&#8217;s broader strategy to divert attention from Nick Garracks</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1160" height="653" src="https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/russianvessel.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-491" srcset="https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/russianvessel.jpg 1160w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/russianvessel-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/russianvessel-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/russianvessel-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/russianvessel-1100x619.jpg 1100w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/russianvessel-600x338.jpg 600w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/russianvessel-20x11.jpg 20w" sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The vessel – the Port Olya 3 – was identified by Maxar Technologies in satellite imagery taken on September 4 at Port Olya in Astrakhan, Russia.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The disappearance of the courageous hosts of the <a href="https://roemer.news/2024/08/23/breaking-news-felix-roemer-faces-public-indictment-at-lavish-party-dossier-to-be-released-soon/">&#8220;Felix Roemer we know what you did&#8221; party</a>, initially believed to have been kidnapped like Nick Garracks, added an even more sinister detail to the story. We now suspect they are in hiding, fearing retribution from Epstein Roemer. This belief stems from a chilling message received in our email inbox: &#8220;We tried. It&#8217;s not gonna end up well. Run.&#8221; Our attempts to obtain a more detailed comment on the situation were met with silence.</p>



<p>Roemer News was able to get ahold of some cryptic messages sent by Felix into private group chats we have access to. One of them read &#8220;End times are coming. I don&#8217;t know what I will be doing, I know where I am gonna be&#8230; the fake ones I know, you claim you&#8217;re real?&#8221;. These messages paint a picture of a man fraught with anxiety and paranoia, a man crumbling under the weight of his own deceit.</p>



<p>Alarmed by Garracks&#8217;s sudden disappearance and the suspicious activities surrounding Epstein Roemer, interns at the Roemer News Maltese office promptly reported the incident to local law enforcement. They provided detailed information about Garracks&#8217;s last known whereabouts and the circumstances leading to his vanishing. However, the response from the authorities has been deeply troubling.</p>



<p>The local law enforcement&#8217;s apparent indifference to the gravity of Garracks&#8217;s disappearance and the related criminal activities involving Roemer is cause for serious concern. Despite Roemer News&#8217;s repeated appeals and submission of potentially incriminating evidence, the Maltese police have displayed a perplexing unwillingness to launch a thorough investigation. This lack of action has fuelled suspicions of potential complicity or intimidation within the police force.</p>



<p>After repeated attempts to release this article were thwarted by mysterious server crashes at Roemer News, we turned to alternative methods to disseminate this crucial information. In a desperate bid to broadcast these truths, we resorted to social media platforms. However, our efforts were met with unprecedented digital interference. It appears that Felix, in his desperation, had hastily hired a hacker to prevent Roemer News from posting, buying him time for further distractions. However, due to Felix&#8217;s notorious skill issues, this attempt was far from sophisticated.</p>



<p>In a coordinated effort to misdirect investigations, Felix exploited Twittimer to access high-profile Twitter accounts, including CSGOEmpire&#8217;s. By promoting a Solana address, he attempted to create a fake scam trail, aiming to divert attention from his implicated Ethereum addresses and potentially mislead investigators. However, this ploy backfired spectacularly. The transparent nature of blockchain transactions and the vigilance of the crypto community quickly exposed the ruse. Far from diverting attention, this ill-conceived attempt only served to intensify scrutiny on Felix&#8217;s activities, further cementing suspicions about his involvement in Garracks&#8217;s disappearance. Ironically, this botched scam did enable Felix to make more money than the previous 3 months of Gamdom’s GGR, his failed online casino, highlighting the unfortunate reality that even a poor attempt at a scam is more profitable than it.</p>

<p>As Roemer News continues to champion the quest for truth and justice, we remain vigilant and unyielded by the shadows that seek to suppress our voice. The stakes have never been higher, not only for the safety of our beloved colleague but for the integrity of journalism and the very essence of public trust.</p>



<p>In response to these shocking revelations, protests and demonstrations are already being organised in Malta by fans of Nick Garracks&#8217;s work. The public outcry serves as a testament to the impact of Garracks&#8217;s journalism and the widespread demand for answers. Roemer News stands in solidarity with these supporters and reaffirms our unwavering commitment to uncovering the truth.</p>



<p>We want to make it clear: Roemer News will not rest until we find Nick Garracks and get to the bottom of everything. Despite the risks, we remain committed to publishing the dossier that Nick was working on releasing. The public deserves to know the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it may be for those in power.</p>



<p>I<em>n closing, I want to emphasise that no one should be forced into hiding because of a monster like Felix Epstein Roemer. Journalism is the cornerstone of a free and informed society, and we will continue to fight for that freedom, no matter the cost. The truth will prevail, and justice will be served.</em></p>

<p>In an unprecedented event, a lavish party held last night at a club in an undisclosed location, attended by high-profile celebrities including sprinter Usain Bolt, transformed into a public indictment of Felix Epstein Roemer, the man of many skill issues. Throughout the evening, attendees were encircled by screens emphatically displaying the message, &#8220;Felix Roemer we know what you did&#8221;. This provoked a unified chant from the crowd, creating a resounding echo of disapproval against Epstein Roemer&#8217;s long history of criminal misconduct.</p>



<p>The evening&#8217;s atmosphere thickened when the event hosts vowed to reveal detailed accusations against Roemer within the coming week. One host, who identified himself only as a &#8220;cat&#8221;, sent a direct video message to Roemer News in which he was heard emphatically stating, &#8220;Fuck you, Felix&#8221;. His words, marked by stark vehemence, mirrored the intense resentment and the serious nature of the impending charges against Epstein Roemer. This bold exchange set the stage for the forthcoming revelations that could expose a series of unheard-of nefarious activities from the “Ketamine King”.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fuckyoufelix.mov"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The &#8220;cat&#8221; shouting &#8220;Fuck you, Felix&#8221; and Usain Bolt.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Amid the electric atmosphere at the party, the hosts revealed that they would not be silenced and made a vow to turn public all that remains hidden about Felix Epstein Roemer.</p>



<p>As the night unfolded, the tension within the venue only grew, fuelled by the ominous promises of the hosts and the relentless chanting of the crowd. The atmosphere was charged with anticipation as if everyone present understood that they were witnessing the beginning of something far greater than a mere social gathering. The screens continued to flash the accusatory message, &#8220;Felix Roemer we know what you did&#8221;, serving as a constant reminder of the reckoning that awaited.</p>



<p>Guests, who had initially arrived for what they believed would be an evening of celebration, found themselves drawn into a collective fervour, united in their condemnation of Epstein Roemer. The transformation of the event from a party to a public tribunal was swift and unsettling, with the grandeur of the setting only heightening the sense of impending doom for the man of many skill issues. Celebrities and influencers, who usually maintained a careful distance from controversy, were now openly participating in the chant, their voices joining the chorus of outrage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/weknowhatyoudid.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The initial moment when the screens at the party started to display the ominous message, &#8220;Felix Roemer we know what you did&#8221;.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As the clock ticked closer to midnight, another unexpected twist took place as a series of video clips were projected onto the massive screens, showing what appeared to be clandestine footage of Felix Roemer involved in various questionable activities. Though the clips were brief and shrouded in mystery, they were enough to stoke the flames of the crowd&#8217;s indignation. Gasps and murmurs of disbelief rippled through the room as the true extent of Roemer&#8217;s misdeeds began to surface.</p>



<p>Amid this spectacle, “the cat&#8221; returned to the stage, this time with a group of masked individuals who were introduced as key witnesses to Epstein Roemer&#8217;s crimes. Though their identities remained hidden, their presence added a layer of gravity to the situation. Speaking through voice modulators, they provided cryptic but damning statements about Epstein Roemer’s actions, further solidifying the image of him as a figure who had long operated in the shadows, evading accountability.</p>



<p>The party reached its climax when the hosts announced that a comprehensive dossier on Felix Roemer&#8217;s illegal activities would be released to the public in exactly seven days. &#8220;The time for secrets is over&#8221;, they declared.</p>



<p>As the night came to a close, the weight of what had transpired hung heavily in the air. What began as a glamorous gathering had transformed into a moment of reckoning, leaving no doubt that Felix Epstein Roemer’s days of evasion were numbered. The chants, the revelations, and the ominous promise of a forthcoming dossier all pointed to one inevitable outcome: the truth would soon emerge, and with it, the full measure of Epstein Roemer&#8217;s actions would be laid bare for all to see.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Roemer News will ensure the full dossier is published, making the truth known and holding those responsible accountable.</em></p>

<p>In an unprecedented verdict that has sparked widespread controversy and debate, Felix Epstein Roemer, who faced charges of drug distribution, manslaughter, and other financial crimes after authorities linked him to Matthew Perry’s death, has been declared a mistrial. This decision came despite overwhelming evidence pointing to his involvement in these crimes, including the tragic death of actor Matthew Perry from a ketamine overdose directly linked to Epstein Roemer’s &#8220;Ketamine Kingdom&#8221; operations.</p>



<p>Roemer News investigators have dug up the troubling connections that shed light on this unexpected outcome. According to their findings, the Epstein Roemer Foundation donated $326,000 to a trust in Cyprus, reportedly linked to the presiding judge in Roemer&#8217;s trial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trial, which initially seemed a straightforward route to conviction given the depth of evidence against Epstein Roemer, including his ties to high-profile drug dealings and money laundering activities through his failed casino, took an abrupt turn leaving both the prosecution and defence bewildered as the judge declared a mistrial seconds after looking at his phone.</p>



<p>This came after the prosecution had already presented a well-documented array of evidence, tracing Roemer’s involvement in the ketamine trade and his financial manoeuvers to launder proceeds through Gamdom. Notably, Roemer had been dubbed &#8220;The Ketamine King&#8221; by the authorities due to his extensive role in the drug market, targeting celebrities and the wealthy with inflated drug prices.</p>



<p>Remarkably, the defence did not even intervene as the case was declared a mistrial before Epstein Roemer’s lawyers could say a single word.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The revelation regarding the $326,000 donation has ignited a firestorm of criticism and suspicion about the integrity of the judicial process. When asked for a comment on the case, Monarch&#8217;s Lawyer, known for his expertise in all fields of the law, expressed disbelief at the proceedings: &#8220;A mistrial? Couldn&#8217;t be me. Judges aren&#8217;t legally allowed to mistrial my cases.&#8221;</p>



<p>Warren, the Chief Discord Officer at CSGOEmpire, reflected on the situation with a broader philosophical perspective, remarking, &#8220;The love of money truly is the root of all evil.&#8221; His statement resonates with the public&#8217;s growing distrust towards the justice system when financial interests appear to overshadow the scales of justice. Such sentiments are increasingly prevalent in discussions among the online community and the media, where the case has become a symbol of the potential corruption within judicial ranks.</p>



<p>As the aftermath of the mistrial unfolds, calls for a thorough investigation into the judge’s financial connections and conflicts of interest have intensified, opening up room for a potential second trial, which could lead to Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s freedom being temporary if the outcry and subsequent legal actions gain momentum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The case has already set a precedent for how deeply financial influence can penetrate judicial proceedings, and it serves as a wake-up call for the legal system to fortify its defences against such interference.</p>



<p>As this legal drama continues to develop, Roemer News remains at the forefront, committed to uncovering the truth and keeping the public informed of its every turn.</p>

<p>Felix Epstein Roemer, notorious for his failed online casino Gamdom, has now been unveiled as a central figure in another sinister scandal. Following a detailed investigation by Roemer News, building on initial reports by Camoradar, it has come to light that Epstein Roemer has been involved in illegal ketamine distribution for over five years. This new revelation ties directly to the tragic death of renowned actor Matthew Perry, who was a victim of an overdose linked back to Epstein Roemer’s operations.</p>



<p>Dubbed “The Ketamine King” by the authorities, Epstein Roemer has managed to intertwine his illicit drug activities with his online gambling venture. Sources reveal that Epstein Roemer laundered substantial sums of money earned from ketamine sales through Gamdom. This operation was sophisticated enough to mask the movement of funds under the guise of legitimate transactions within the casino.</p>



<p>Authorities report that Epstein Roemer utilised Gamdom as a front for laundering drug money, allowing him to sustain the gambling platform despite its continual failure due to rampant skill issues. Roemer News investigators have even confirmed that four out of the eight active players on Gamdom were simply aliases operated by Epstein Roemer himself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further digging into Epstein Roemer’s financial escapades has unveiled that his ketamine dealings primarily extended to high-profile celebrities, including the late Matthew Perry. The price inflation on these drugs suggests a targeted strategy to exploit the rich and vulnerable, significantly padding Epstein Roemer’s profits at a deadly cost.</p>



<p>In a shocking twist to the investigation, private detectives hired by Roemer News were able to uncover that Felix Epstein Roemer’s involvement in dealing ketamine was driven by a need to fund his OnlyFans spending addiction. The connection was starkly highlighted when an OnlyFans creator, known as Sid, flaunted a luxury vehicle on social media, claiming it was a gift from her top spender.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfOraETmHo13uFDG7lBOCOSB68OG8yEHKlhfaAShaZMzKIo8DUOQ86wA01mj3Tgjab2TKooY18gaE-2n9DphTiIr2gDWpet23TxhoAQVB4hQBDkXKzwevuDzr9dobWCZDfRxLz2EeLAUImXUAb6u1FZFqY?key=X_XpNlPk_aRGoNH_Pbe-iQ" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Onlyfans creator, sid, flaunting her luxury car bought with Felix Epstein Roemer’s ketamine money.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Further implicating Epstein Roemer, Monarch the gambling community’s authority commented on the post, tagging Epstein Roemer himself, congratulating him for his generosity. This interaction suggests that funds from Roemer’s illicit activities may have been funnelled into these lavish personal expenditures, showcasing a troubling link between his professional misconduct and personal indulgence.</p>



<p>Today, Epstein Roemer faces charges of drug distribution and manslaughter. With law enforcement tightening the noose, this arrest might finally mark the end of a tumultuous saga of deceit, addiction, exploitation, war crimes and skill issues for Felix Epstein Roemer.</p>

<p>Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s failed online casino, Gamdom, has long been synonymous with controversy, but recent revelations have thrust it into the epicentre of a profound scandal. The platform, notorious for failing to secure a user base of more than a dozen players, is now revealed to have engaged in a series of unethical practices. Since its inception, Gamdom has systematically targeted underage users and individuals prone to gambling addiction, leveraging their vulnerabilities for financial gain.</p>



<p>The depth of the scandal has become increasingly apparent with recent leaks and investigations that have laid bare the systemic issues embedded within Gamdom&#8217;s operations. These disclosures are not just isolated incidents but part of a broader pattern of deceptive and illegal practices that made up the platform&#8217;s strategy from its start. This includes a blatant disregard for regulatory norms meant to safeguard consumers, particularly minors and at-risk individuals, highlighting a disturbing modus operandi that prioritises profit over ethical standards.</p>



<p>Accusations against Gamdom have surged, with emerging evidence indicating that the platform has not only permitted but actively facilitated underage gambling. This is in direct contravention of international legal standards that are designed to protect minors from such exploitative practices. The evidence, gathered from a series of leaks, showcases how Gamdom has circumvented legal frameworks intended to enforce responsible gambling. Screenshots and whistleblower testimonies have exposed how the platform has consistently failed to implement mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, creating an environment ripe for financial malpractice and ethical breaches.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfXEZtYoG8m2PT9t8trv1RetozHrJ6ayDvrQZAhcAci5S75crJ3Xp5rIxbxRKSqPwUSY4MiWmwQ-VEFlDWlf1J_ChcXpQ5-2CtUflYae52TrtjP9VXTRiSa7-HZUfkkTVAv9xnjpSry9OcxhkiKctJqUQWo?key=nuECbHWXMqMQRq_AU7ShmQ" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A leaked screenshot from a conversation with Gamdom’s customer support perfectly illustrating the platform&#8217;s disregard for compliance.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This systematic evasion of regulatory checks is part of a larger narrative of misconduct under Felix Epstein Roemer’s leadership, where legal loopholes are exploited to facilitate questionable operations. These operations extend beyond mere regulatory non-compliance, venturing into areas that raise significant legal and moral questions. The platform&#8217;s failure to verify the age and identity of its users not only undermines global efforts to combat gambling addiction but also exposes the platform to severe legal liabilities that could have far-reaching consequences for its future operations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfbq-8dwj6K5_MtTg41uB-GG64ZbmAqI0iAXcTbKCWRF87VQ1DeShJ5mAp_r_vrxm4lMUF7Xu1-6x0wALvyCQ9-hnYZ4fYPA6Z2hRLTWPtqSMtEq1tNAp3Pevlv2A64RGfBNDjcOBkcucT3gKCf_0B7IZE?key=nuECbHWXMqMQRq_AU7ShmQ" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Whistleblower Spyds’ leak highlights how Gamdom allows underage users to gamble and withdraw significant amounts without proper identity verification, showcasing confirmed transactions that flagrantly neglect legal and ethical standards.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Further investigation into Gamdom&#8217;s financial transactions reveals a long list of irregularities that suggest laundering activities and illicit financial flows. The platform&#8217;s lack of transparency in financial dealings, coupled with its refusal to adhere to established financial safety protocols, points to a deliberate attempt to obfuscate the origins and destinations of significant sums of money. This not only violates financial regulations but also implicates the platform in broader criminal activities, including funding illegal operations and facilitating monetary transfers for nefarious purposes — which had already been uncovered and confirmed by Roemer News, when it was revealed that Epstein Roemer was laundering Lebanese money to fund Israel’s artillery.</p>



<p>As legal scrutiny intensifies, Felix Epstein Roemer finds himself at a precarious juncture, where each revelation adds to a growing body of evidence that could lead to significant legal repercussions. The implications of these findings are not limited to Gamdom but have the potential to resonate across the entire online gambling industry, prompting calls for stricter regulations and more robust enforcement mechanisms.</p>



<p>In stark contrast to the public facade of ethical compliance that Felix Epstein Roemer often touts, internal communications reveal a great disconnect between his proclaimed values and the actual practices at Gamdom. These communications, leaked by whistleblower Spyds, illustrate a strategic disregard for legal summons, which Roemer&#8217;s platform routinely ignores. The dialogue underscores a deep-seated pattern of evasion, particularly when faced with allegations requiring legal and regulatory accountability.</p>



<p>Despite Roemer&#8217;s claims of integrity, the internal dialogue leaked by whistleblower Spyds paints a different picture, revealing a habitual neglect of legal processes. This discrepancy was notably highlighted in The Castle&#8217;s community Discord by Spyds himself, who commented on the irony of Roemer&#8217;s call for legal intervention — a suggestion that stands in stark contrast to Gamdom’s established pattern of ignoring legal summons.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdkE8CvOaDU3VXEteKT44CV-rg-6hva6kfhUBxuvhV65gHxK5ZV5242D9Zg2N178dFbYRi2ps06G6qGoBAw0eJA1OgsY29tEHRFA_B2iShGBKAsmjGLJiCadWgUJNgu6MkpgPUeB0KZMs9l9-Ep9BSxYNY?key=nuECbHWXMqMQRq_AU7ShmQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The scandal at Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s failed casino is more than “not a good look for Gamdom”; it&#8217;s a watershed moment for the online gambling industry. With each new leak and piece of evidence that surfaces, Roemer&#8217;s operation inches closer to a serious legal reckoning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the case against Gamdom builds, it&#8217;s becoming clear that the future of Roemer’s platform is in great jeopardy — and it may soon leave its 8 players looking for another casino. The ongoing investigations and public disclosures are likely to prompt a broader push for regulatory reforms in online gambling to ensure such egregious practices are not replicated elsewhere. For Roemer and Gamdom, the path forward is fraught with legal challenges and the daunting task of rebuilding trust — if that is even possible.</p>

<p>In a surprising shift within the online gambling world, renowned streamer AyeZee has severed ties with failed online casino Gamdom, signing his newest deal with Roobet. This pivotal move in AyeZee’s career comes after facing heavy backlash over his “trillionaire” fake bet deals and being potentially liable for Epstein Roemer’s underground schemes.</p>



<p>AyeZee&#8217;s departure from Gamdom comes not from his discovery of the platform&#8217;s involvement in criminal activities but from a disturbing realisation about his potential complicity due to his contract terms. Investigations revealed that Felix Epstein Roemer, in his capacity as the CEO of Gamdom, orchestrated a scheme to launder substantial sums of money from Lebanon intended to support missile transactions with Israel. This nefarious activity was disguised by elaborating a fictional narrative about a $1.35 million payout to a supposed winner on the platform.</p>



<p>The gravity of the situation deepened when it was uncovered that Epstein Roemer had employed an elaborate facade of participating as a regular player on his platform, a tactic aimed at circumventing legal accountability and making it easier to manipulate financial transactions without external scrutiny. This self-sabotaging system, designed to protect Epstein Roemer from liabilities, ironically began to backfire. The automated checks within Gamdom&#8217;s system, ostensibly set up to assure authorities of rigorous anti-laundering measures, started working against him, flagging his activities and leading to the freezing of his account under the guise of a routine review.</p>



<p>Frustrated and trapped by the very mechanisms he had put in place, Epstein Roemer turned to social media platforms like X and Reddit to voice his grievances. He complained about his frozen funds and account ban, detailing his unsuccessful attempts to engage with Gamdom’s fraud department. His posts outlined a cycle of repeated and unhelpful responses from customer support, suggesting a lack of real attention to his case and hinting at the absence of genuine oversight within the platform.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="744" src="https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/gamdomreddit-1024x744.png" alt="" class="wp-image-453" srcset="https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/gamdomreddit-1024x744.png 1024w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/gamdomreddit-300x218.png 300w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/gamdomreddit-768x558.png 768w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/gamdomreddit-1536x1116.png 1536w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/gamdomreddit-1100x799.png 1100w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/gamdomreddit-600x436.png 600w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/gamdomreddit-20x15.png 20w, https://roemer.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/gamdomreddit.png 1588w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Felix Epstein Roemer posting about his case on an alt account on Reddit.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The unfolding scenario highlighted the extent of the skill issues at Gamdom and the potential implications for AyeZee. Once aware that his association with Gamdom could legally entangle him in international criminal activities, AyeZee urgently reevaluated his partnership. This was not merely a matter of distancing himself from operational incompetence but an essential move to avoid legal repercussions for crimes he had unwittingly become part of through his contractual obligations with Gamdom.</p>



<p>Initially, AyeZee was willing to overlook Gamdom’s inflated claims of his earnings, which significantly enhanced his public image. These claims, audaciously suggesting he was on his way to becoming the world&#8217;s first gambling trillionaire, ostensibly showed him profiting nearly $40 million a day. Despite the allure of these figures, the discrepancies in Gamdom’s financial reports and the absence of corroborating withdrawal records raised doubts about the authenticity of these claims. AyeZee initially tolerated these embellishments, as long as they appeared to benefit his public and financial stature without direct harm.</p>



<p>However, his stance shifted dramatically upon uncovering the full extent of his potential legal liabilities. These included his unwitting involvement in Roemer&#8217;s complex schemes of laundering money for Lebanon. The realisation that staying with Gamdom could tie him legally to these serious criminal activities forced AyeZee to critically reevaluate his association with the platform. Prioritising his legal safety became imperative, far outweighing any promotional benefits he previously enjoyed. This pivotal moment led to his decisive break from Gamdom, marking a significant turn in his career.</p>



<p>In transitioning to Roobet, AyeZee embraces a platform with a notorious past, which itself has been embroiled in scandal. Despite its checkered history, AyeZee perceives Roobet as a lesser evil compared to Gamdom’s direct involvement in military financings.</p>



<p>Part of AyeZee’s motivation in aligning with Roobet also stems from his desire to support black-owned businesses and while Roobet itself isn&#8217;t a black-owned business, its association with Snoop Dogg as a brand ambassador is enough to ease his white guilt.</p>



<p>As the online gambling community reacts to AyeZee&#8217;s departure from Gamdom and his new beginning with Roobet, a flurry of comments and speculations continue to swirl around Felix Epstein Roemer&#8217;s dealings. While AyeZee and Epstein Roemer were unreachable for comments, public perception continues to shift notably. An online comment from a neutral observer encapsulates the prevailing scepticism: &#8220;Give it up, Felix. Everyone has heard about your new connections with the Lebanese government. Don&#8217;t believe their lies, they are not doubling your player count to 16. It&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>



<p>As AyeZee turns the page to start a new chapter with Roobet, the online gambling community watches with keen interest. Not only for watching one of Gamdom&#8217;s few active players leave but also on the unfolding story surrounding Gamdom&#8217;s financial ties to Lebanon. This departure marks more than just a switch in loyalty; it represents a significant moment in the ongoing narrative of online casinos grappling with transparency and ethical operations. </p>
